                    <p>We don't rely on third parties for supply of potential candidates. Every day hundreds of youth
                        come to our company, while many send their bio-data and work experience through our website and
                        e-mail for overseas employment, drawn by the reputation of the quality service we provide. Every
                        information of these candidates are entered into our virtual databank by our recruitment
                        officers in “Employment Opportunity Service Desk”. At present, we have thousands of such CVs in
                        our Databank stored in our website <strong><a
                                href="pacificoverseas.org">www.pacificoverseas.org</a></strong></p>

                            <p>Each potential candidate must face preliminary interview with our recruitment officers
                                before the final selection. We use two interview techniques for the selection of
                                short-listed candidates.</p>

                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1. Video Call:</strong> This technique is for those who are too busy to come to
                                Nepal for interviewing the candidates selected in preliminary section. We make every
                                arrangement for the interview between employers and the employee through video call.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>2. Final Interview:</strong> Many employers visit Nepal for final interview. We
                                make all necessary preparations for interview. We call shortlisted candidates for the
                                particular day. We have fully equipped AC rooms and other modern facilities - computers,
                                telephones, Internet, and all that an interviewer might need.</li>
                            <li><strong> Employment Contract:</strong> The employing company provide the employee
                                employment agreement as per demand letter.</li>
                            <li><strong> 3. On the behalf of the employer:</strong> Sometimes, manpower importing
                                agencies give full authority to us for entire selection procedures. In such case, we
                                carry out interviews on behalf of employers abroad and make all dispatching arrangements
                                to the employment destination.</li>

                            <p>The basic method of selection for skilled professionals is through trade tests and other
                                techniques. A committee which includes representatives from the employing organization
                                and our own Technical Training Institute carries out skill tests of all skilled manpower
                                in the concerned discipline. Only those persons recommended by the selection committee
                                are selected for overseas employment.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>If special manpower with specific experience is needed, we use our official network
                                located in different districts to headhunt such individual. Headhunting does not limit
                                only in the domestic market for supplying the need of highly professional manpower.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The discipline level of each and every worker is tested so as to avoid possible risks
                                from the workers abroad. We examine the workers' morality, attitude, behavior and
                                personal history. Team of our experts including a psychiatrist carries out these tests.
                                Candidates have to go through medical tests after final selection. Only medically fit
                                candidates are eligible to sign an agreement or contract paper.</p>
